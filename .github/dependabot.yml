# Support for pub is in beta, and thus, we are aware of some limitations. For example, security updates are not supported in this release but will be in the future.
#
# Other known limitations:
#
# - No support for updating git-dependencies
# - If the version found is ignored (by dependabot config) no update will happen (even if, an earlier version could be used)
# - No support for private package repositories
